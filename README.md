# vStorage
FiveM jobs Storage script created with RageUI library

# Explaination
With this script, you will be able to open a storage menu of your society. (just to add the export to your job script)
Note: this script is independent, so if the societies on your server already have items, then with this script they will not have any items. (is not using esx_addoninventory)

# Usage
```lua
exports["vStorage"]:openStorageMenu();
```
